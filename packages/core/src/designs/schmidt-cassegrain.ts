/**
 * The Schmidt-Cassegrain: a Cassegrain-form two-mirror telescope whose spherical
 * primary is corrected by a Schmidt aspheric plate at its centre of curvature,
 * with a convex confocal-hyperboloid secondary relaying the beam to a focus
 * behind the primary. It is the fifth reflecting preset, and it exists to
 * *compose* the two units that came before it: the Schmidt camera's corrector
 * figure (§ 5g) and the Cassegrain-form layout + confocal secondary (§ 5e).
 *
 * ## Which Schmidt-Cassegrain this is — read this before extending it
 *
 * This is a **Schmidt-corrected Cassegrain**: a spherical primary + a Schmidt
 * corrector nulling its spherical aberration + an *aspheric* (hyperboloidal)
 * confocal secondary. It is NOT the commercial "compact SCT" (Celestron/Meade),
 * whose primary AND secondary are BOTH spheres and whose corrector is an
 * OPTIMISED, proprietary surface figured to null the *combined* two-mirror
 * spherical aberration. That surface has no external number to pin it to, so it
 * would violate the project's hard rule (new capability pinned to
 * textbook/closed-form/published values) — the tension is recorded in
 * `cassegrain.ts`. The variant built here keeps every number a closed form:
 *
 *  - The corrector figure is the Schmidt camera's textbook A₄, referenced to the
 *    PRIMARY's radius (below). Reused verbatim, not re-derived.
 *  - The secondary is the classical Cassegrain's confocal hyperboloid, reused
 *    verbatim from `twoMirrorLayout` — because once the corrector makes the
 *    sphere behave (to third order) like the paraboloid the confocal pairing
 *    expects, the same secondary relays it stigmatically.
 *
 * The all-spherical commercial SCT belongs to a later unit that transcribes the
 * published two-mirror Seidel corrector formula (Schroeder Ch. 6; Rutten & van
 * Venrooij) rather than deriving it here.
 *
 * ## The corrector figure — reused from the Schmidt camera (§ 5g)
 *
 * The corrector sits at the primary's centre of curvature (a distance R₁ = 2f₁
 * in front of the primary vertex), which is also the aperture stop. Because the
 * object is at infinity the beam there is collimated, so an on-axis ray keeps its
 * height from plate to primary and the r⁴ figure derived at the mirror applies
 * unchanged at the plate. A sphere carries r⁴/(4R₁³) of spherical aberration
 * against the paraboloid of the same vertex radius; a plate of index n whose
 * thickness varies as r⁴ cancels it when
 *
 *     (n−1)·A₄·r⁴ = −r⁴/(4R₁³)      ⇒      A₄ = −1/(4·(n−1)·R₁³)
 *
 * — the SAME closed form the Schmidt camera pins, with the mirror radius now the
 * PRIMARY's R₁, not the system's. Signed thickest at the rim. n is dispersive, so
 * A₄ is figured for one wavelength and the correction drifts away from it: the
 * Schmidt's residual **spherochromatism**, which the trace shows for free.
 *
 * ## The stop is on the corrector, NOT the primary
 *
 * This is the one structural difference from the classical Cassegrain (whose stop
 * is the paraboloidal primary). Placing the stop at the corrector — the primary's
 * centre of curvature — is what lets the r⁴ figure transfer exactly, and it is
 * also why this preset does NOT share the Cassegrain's field behaviour: a
 * different stop position gives different coma and astigmatism, so those are not
 * cross-validated against `cassegrain` here. Only the *mirror geometry* is shared
 * (radii, separation, secondary conic, obstruction, secondary footprint) — the
 * on-axis marginal footprint is stop-independent because the input beam is
 * collimated, which is what makes reusing `twoMirrorLayout` valid.
 *
 * ## On axis it is diffraction-limited, NOT exactly stigmatic
 *
 * Like the Schmidt camera and unlike the confocal Cassegrain, the corrector nulls
 * only the THIRD-order spherical aberration; a fifth-order residual survives and
 * is relayed through the secondary. So the on-axis rung is "diffraction-limited,
 * and a large factor better than the corrector-removed system" — never
 * "Strehl = 1", which is the classical Cassegrain's (~1e-10) property alone. That
 * residual falls steeply as the primary is slowed, the signature of a
 * higher-order term. Its reason to exist over the all-reflective Cassegrain is
 * the cheap SPHERICAL primary, and the two rungs that make it non-redundant are
 * exactly the two prices that buys: the fifth-order on-axis residual and the
 * refractive corrector's spherochromatism.
 *
 * ## Geometry (all magnitudes; engine signs applied at the end)
 *
 *     corrector front   z = 0                 (stop, at the primary's CoC)
 *     corrector back    z = plateThickness
 *     primary vertex    z = R₁ = 2f₁          (spherical, concave toward −z)
 *     secondary vertex  z = R₁ − d            (between corrector and primary)
 *     focus             z = R₁ + b            (b behind the primary vertex)
 *
 * The incoming collimated beam is not tested against the secondary in the
 * sequential trace — the secondary is met only on the returning leg — so its
 * central obstruction is ε bookkeeping in the pupil function, exactly as for the
 * classical Cassegrain.
 *
 * SCOPE. As for the Cassegrain (§ 5e) and Schmidt (§ 5g): the primary's central
 * hole and the secondary's obstruction are not traced as blockers; the curved
 * (Petzval) focal surface is unpinned (rungs measure by Zernike coefficient at
 * best focus, so field-curvature defocus does not contaminate them); off-axis
 * coma/astigmatism are present in the trace but unpinned, since with the stop at
 * the corrector they are neither the classical Cassegrain's nor a clean closed
 * form. All are recorded in docs/VALIDATION.md § 5h.
